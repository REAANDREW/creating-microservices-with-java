# Microservices in Java

This is a small project for me to explore how I would go about creating Microservices in Java following good practices and principles that apply to any language.

Some of the characteristics of the solution I want to end up with include:

- I do not want to use a framework
- I do want to use libraries for common things like TRANSPORT, DATA ACCESS, LOGGING, MONITORING etc...
- I do want to focus on using good programming practices and principles
- I want to use the hexaganol architectural style
- I want to be able to test the application like I would with Golang, Node.js, Python etc...
- I want to able to easily deploy the application inside a Container using Docker
- I want to follow the principles contained inside the Reactive Manifesto

> IMPORTANT 
> - I want this to be simple to create, understand, explain and extend.
